all of my hotkeys


To run them, you'll probably need some other programs.

# AutoHotKey

https://autohotkey.com/

For Windows users only!  

To run `.ahk` files  
Download this program from the link.  
During installation select **Unicode** option.  

After download, you can run some file `xyz.ahk`  
* by double clicking it  
* from terminal as executable (windows should know how to run `.ahk`)  
* using installed `.exe` which is located where you installed AutoHotKey
